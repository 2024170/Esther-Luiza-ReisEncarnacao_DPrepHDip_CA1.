# 🧹 Data Preparation – HDip Project (CA1)

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Higher Diploma in Data Analytics** coursework. It focuses on **data preparation techniques** including cleaning, preprocessing, handling missing values, and preparing the data for further analysis or modeling.

The dataset used contains information related to students dataset, and the notebook demonstrates various steps in preparing raw data into a usable form.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and apply data preparation methods
- Handle null/missing values using appropriate techniques
- Perform data type conversions and encoding
- Detect and treat outliers
- Explore and summarize datasets using statistical methods

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **CSV file handling**

---

## 🔍 Key Processes Performed
- Loading and inspecting raw data
- Dropping/replacing null values
- Encoding categorical variables (label encoding / one-hot if applicable)
- Creating new features from existing ones
- Performing basic visualizations to support preparation decisions
- Saving cleaned datasets for future use

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `DPrep_CA1_Notebook.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all preprocessing steps
- `data/`: Folder containing raw and processed data files
- `README.md`: Project summary
